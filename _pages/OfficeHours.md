I enjoy meeting with students. If you'd like to meet with me, feel free to schedule a 15-minute appointment [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UU9RaXp0Q1JwTHVvfGRlZmF1bHR8M2M0M2E3ZDkyYzNlMWFmMzdiZWQ4MWNhYTUwYTNkZjU). I periodically add more slots, so don't fret if there currently aren't any available. Graduate students should feel free to book two consecutive 15-minute slots if needed. I look forward to talking with you!

I also hold a weekly open Zoom office hours for Econ 1630 students. Please check the syllabus on Canvas for details.
