The unavailability of potential stem cell donors poses a critical challenge for donor registries worldwide. This study investigates the impact of initiatives of a stem cell donor registry to enhance donors' availability for confirmatory typing. Initiatives ask donors to provide a sample for genetic analysis and/or information on their temporal unavailability. We analyzed 91,479 confirmatory typing requests from DKMS Germany, a large stem cell donor registry, exploiting a quasi-random initiative assignment based on observable characteristics. We find that, first, invitation to the initiatives increases donors' availability. Intention-to-treat estimates yield effects ranging from 2.5 to 3.2 percentage points, and local average treatment effects estimates range from 3.8 to 8.2 percentage points (baseline: 77.1%). Second, the difference in availability between participants and non-participants is over 10 percentage points. The initiatives yield a direct positive effect on donor availability and a selection effect through which participation signals a higher commitment.

**Helping and Antisocial Behavior in the Workplace** (with Patrick Kampkötter, Michael Kosfeld, and Ferdinand von Siemens). 2022.

Using representative employer-employee panel data of German firms, we show that differences in supervisors' people skills, as well as workforce trust, social preferences, and personality traits explain firm-level differences in helping and antisocial behavior in the workplace. Our measures are derived from established survey constructs and include preference items that have been behaviorally validated in experimental games by prior research. Together, the results corroborate the importance of both leadership quality and workforce composition for the manifestation of helpful and hostile workplace cultures.

**Getting up to speed: Informing prior and prospective blood donors about supply uncertainty and hygiene measures during the COVID-19 lockdown** (with Stefanie Ehmann and Anne Heynold). 2022.

The already uncertain supply of whole blood from donors has been made even more volatile by the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential reasons for the persistence of this shock are unawareness of the supply drop, and fear of infection while donating. The primary aim of this study is to test efficacy of measures used by donation organizations and media to appeal to donors and non-donors to donate blood and ensure donor safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim is to explore why some donors donated less as a result of the pandemic. Using a survey experiment with 1,207 participants, we test the effect of informing subjects about donation urgency (shortage information), and secondly, the effect of reducing the potential fear of a SARS-CoV-2 infection (hygiene information) on their inclination to donate before and after the COVID-19 lockdown ended. The results show that shortage information increases willingness to donate for prospective blood donors by 15 percentage points (pp), and increases the willingness of (prospective) donors to donate within the next month by 12pp (9pp), on average. Hygiene information reduces the intention of prior donors to donate again by 8pp, on average. The experimental results are corroborated by evidence from previous donations, showing a 12pp lower likelihood to donate less in 2020 than in 2019 for those who had been informed about shortages by donation organizations. The results suggest that interventions focusing on the marginal impact of donation are more effective than interventions focusing on marginal costs.
