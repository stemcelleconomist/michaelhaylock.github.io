I am a postdoctoral researcher in the economics department at the Chair of Health Economics, which is part of CINCH at the University of Duisburg-Essen.

My primary research interests are in health economics, with a focus on stem-cell donation. I have also worked on topics in organizational economics.

I received my PhD in economics in 2022 from the University of TÃ¼bingen, where I received a best paper award for my single-author paper. I did my B.A. in philosophy and economics at the University of Bayreuth.
